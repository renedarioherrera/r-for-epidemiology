# Tidy Data

This page is still being worked on.

## Learning Objectives

In this chapter, readers will:

-   identify what makes data "tidy"
-   identify how to make messy data tidy

## Introduction

After importing my data, but before any meaningful data analysis, I make sure my data is "tidy". Tidy data follows three rules as suggested by [Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html):

1.  Each variable must have its own column.
2.  Each observation must have its own row.
3.  Each value must have its own cell.
